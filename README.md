# -NeuroGuard-Embedded-Parkinson-s-Detection-System
This project uses an mbed microcontroller to detect Parkinson's tremors with a gyroscope sensor. It initializes gyroscope settings, configures interrupts, and processes data for 15 seconds. Results are displayed on an LCD in real-time, showing tremor detection.
